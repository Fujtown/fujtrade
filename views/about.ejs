                              <div class="fund-protection-section">
                                  <h3>Protecting your funds is our priority</h3>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>We're also regulated in seven other jurisdictions worldwide through our affiliates</li>
                                      <li>All customer deposits are kept separate from our own operating funds and distributed across a global network of custodian banks</li>
                                      <li>Your money is held with top-tier banks and we have trust letters in place to ensure your money remains segregated from the assets of the bank</li>
                                      <li>We enforce robust bank review and monitoring guidelines which are set by the Risk Committee of StoneX Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SNEX)</li>
                                      <li>We never engage in proprietary trading</li>
                                  </ul>
                              </div>
  
                              <p>A brokerage firm acts as an intermediary that brings together buyers and sellers to execute transactions for shares, bonds, options, and other financial instruments. It receives a commission or fee for the job it does. Depending on the level of service it provides and if there is direct contact with human beings rather than computer algorithms, the distinction can be made between full-service (traditional) and discount (online) brokerage.</p>

                              <p>Full-service brokers offer a range of products and services, including market research and personal financial advisors to provide help and guidance to each client. With online brokers, investors themselves input their buy and sell orders electronically into the broker's automated trading platform.</p>
